## Problem Statement
Adventure Works is a bike manufacturer also dealing in components, accessories and clothing related to biking.
It generates business through online (retail) and reseller (B2B) sales channels. Currently, the company is struggling with competitive pressures 
in online sales in some geographies, where it is losing out to the competition, and certain sections of the customer base. 
Brian Welcker, VP - Sales, needs to tackle these issues but with a data-driven approach. However, he is experiencing challenges in extracting 
actionable insights from the companyâ€™s disparate data sources. The company uses multiple systems for inventory management, customer relationship management (CRM), 
and point-of-sale (POS) transactions. However, these systems are not integrated, resulting in fragmented data that is difficult to analyze.
